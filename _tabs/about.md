My Name is Chase Dubauskas. I’m a Jr. Software Developer with a bachelor's degree in applied information systems technology who is currently working with computer vision. My passion for computers and all things technology stems from a very young age. I’m constantly learning, and finding ways to improve my skill set.

This website serves as a collection of guides/notes for my installations within 
my homelab, that can be followed by others to achieve similar results.

In my spare time, I am always tinkering with some new technology or tool. My “Homelab” is a place where I can practice my skills from system administration/networking to software development. I’m pursuing a career as a DevOps engineer, and having this playground to hone my skills has proved invaluable. When I’m not at a computer, I’m indulging in my other hobbies. I’m a home theatre enthusiast, a 3D printer hobbyist, a gamer, and an outdoor enthusiast!
