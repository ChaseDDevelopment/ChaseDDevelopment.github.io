My Name is Chase Dubauskas. I'm a Jr. Software Developer with a bachelors degree in applied information systems technology that is currently working with computer vision. My passion for computers and all things technology stems from a very young age. I'm constantly learning, and finding ways to improve my skillset.

This website serves as a collection of guides/notes for my installations within my homelab, that can be followed by others to achieve similair results. 

In my spare time I am always tinkering with some new technology or tool. My "Homelab" is a place where I can practice my skills from system administration/networking to software developent. I'm pursuing a career as a devops engineer, and having this playground to hone my skills has proved invaluable. When I'm not at a computer, I'm indulging my other hobbies. I'm a home theatre enthusiast, a 3D printer hobbyist, a gamer, and outdoor enthusiast!
