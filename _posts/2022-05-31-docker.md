# Docker Basics

If you're new to homelabbing, or looking for a place to get started, the tool that I've found to be the most useful in my homelab is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

It will allow you to experiment and quickly spin up any service with only a few lines of code, with the ability to easily remove that service if it's not to your liking. 

I will be showing you how to install, use and build a Docker image in this guide. 

> For the purposes of this guide, I will be using Docker on a [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) based system, and interfacing with docker using a terminal. While you can use Docker on MacOs and Windows, they require the use of a desktop application.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization engine, that allows you to quickly develop, ship and run applications. while there are other containerization engines out there, I use Docker because it is available on all the major platforms (Linux, MacOs, Windows). 

Compared to traditional deployments, Docker allows you to run multiple services from one machine, much like how a Virtual Machine works, but with less overhead, and without the need to run an entire operating system per virtual machine. (See Below)

Because each service is "contained" within it's own container, and packaged with all the dependencies that an application will need to run properly, it helps prevent any dependency conflicts, while keeping your application size small, and efficient. 

> If you'd like a deeper dive into Docker and it's underlying concepts, take a look at the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/), but for now, I'm sticking to a broad overview, with a quick-start guide to get running with Docker

## Installing Docker on Ubuntu

Now for the fun part! We're going to install Docker! You can follow this guide, or the official installation guide on Dockers documentation site. [Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) Recently Docker also released the Docker Desktop app for Linux, and while it's nice to have a GUI to manage containers, We're going to be installing the Docker Engine through the terminal as this is a Homelab guide for servers. 

For the sake of this guide, I will assume that you have installed either `Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS`, or `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`, If you haven't stay tuned as I'll be creating a guide on how to install those operating systems!

>There are three main ways to install Docker on Ubuntu ([Setup Docker's Repositories](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository), [Install the .Deb package](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-from-a-package), and [The Convenience Script](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script)), We will be setting up Dockers Repositories.

### Set up the repository

1. Update the `apt` package index and install packages to allow `apt` to use a repository over HTTPS:

```bash
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
  ca-certificates \
  curl \
  gnupg \
  lsb-release
```

2. Add Docker's official GPG key:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```
